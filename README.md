# HTMLtoPDF
**Aim :** To generate pdfs from HTML templates.

**Problem :**  There were many online solutions specifying ***pdfkit*** which uses * *wkhtmmltopdf* * library.But It requires global installation and manual path configuration.I found it difficult for a beginner to setup and use this

**Solution :** Finally after scrolling through 10s of websites and posts on stackoverflow,I found this ***WeasyPrint*** package.It was easy to install and run.


WeasyPrint is a smart solution helping web developers to create PDF documents. It turns simple HTML pages into gorgeous statistical reports, invoices, ticketsâ€¦

From a technical point of view, WeasyPrint is a visual rendering engine for HTML and CSS that can export to PDF and PNG. It aims to support web standards for printing. WeasyPrint is free software made available under a BSD license.

It is based on various libraries but not on a full rendering engine like WebKit or Gecko. The CSS layout engine is written in Python, designed for pagination, and meant to be easy to hack on.
